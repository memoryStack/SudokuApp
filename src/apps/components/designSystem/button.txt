Questions
    1. what is the difference between the "filled" and "filled tonal" buttons
        and when we should use each of these ??
    2. 


types of buttons
    1. filled button
        let's call these as CTA buttons as well.
    
    2. outlined button/Ghost button
        This kind of buttons helps to set the visual hierarchy in case there 
        are several CTA elements: the core CTA is presented in a filled button 
        while the secondary (still active) is given in a ghost button.
        
    3. Text button
        Text buttons are usually used to create secondary interactive zones without
        distracting from the main controls or CTA elements.

    b. subtle
    c. secondary

            "accent" even mean.
    
    each button will be in 2 states
        a. default
        b. disabled
        Note: on web we have "hover" state as well
    
    parts of a button to style
        a. background
        b. border

        d. text/copy

    example of tokens for a button's color would be like
    TODO: know the most used rule on how to maintain the hierarchy. in Tekion we have a different
            hierarchy. it starts with css property instead of the element.

    "button": {
        "primary": {
            "default": {
                "background": {
                    "color": {
                        value: "red",
                        type: "color"
                    }
                    ...other properties of background to style
                }
                ...other parts of button to color
            },
            ...other states of a button
        }
        ...other types of buttons
