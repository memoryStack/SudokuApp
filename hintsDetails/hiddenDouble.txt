In Hidden Single, we focus on one candidate and one cell only. Hidden Double is
the extension of Hidden Single. Here we will focus on two candidates and two cells.

a Hidden Double is formed when two candidates are present together only in two
cells and nowhere else in any row, column or block.

in 1st block, 4 and 7 have Hidden Double here
000060000000042736006730040094000068000096407607050923100000085060080271005010094

notice that in 1st block, 4 and 7 are present together only in cellA and cellB. this is a
Hidden Double in this block. the word "Hidden" is used because in cellA and cellB cells 4 and 7
are hidden behind other candidates. and it's a little harder to find.

# Invalid Hidden Double
000065000000042736006730040094000068000096407607050923100000085069080271005010094
here in 6th column, 8 and 9 are present two times only but these are not in same cells.
in cell C6 these are together but 2nd 8 and 9 are in F6 and G6 cells respectively.
so it's an invalid Hidden Double.

# notes elimination pattern
Logic behind eliminating the candidates
since these two candidates appear in these two cells only so these cells will be filled by 
these candidates only and all the other candidates will be removed from these cells.
000060000000042736006730040094000068000096407607050923100000085060080271005010094
so in 1st block, A1 and A2 will be filled by 4 and 7 and 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9 will be removed.
which candidate will fill which cell is still unknown.
