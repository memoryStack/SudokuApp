In Hidden Double, we focus on two candidates and two cells. In Hidden Tripple number
of candidates and cells increases to three.

a Hidden Tripple is formed when three candidates are present together only in three
cells and nowhere else in any row, column or block. and each of these three cells 
must have atleast two out of these three candidates.

# in 6th column, 2, 5 and 6 make a Hidden Tripple here

notice that in 6th column, 2, 5 and 6 are present together only in D6, F6 and H6. this is a
Hidden Tripple in this column. the word "Hidden" is used because in D6, F6 and H6 2, 5 and 6
are hidden behind other candidates. and it's a little harder to find.
Also notice that H6 doesn't have 5 in it. it's still a valid Hidden Tripple because a cell can
have atleast two out of three candidates and here H6 satisfies that condition.

# Invalid Hidden Tripple

here in 9th row, focus on 1, 3 and 9. these numbers are present in more than three cells.
if 1 and 3 weren't present in I3 cell then it would have been a valid Hidden Tripple.

here in 6th column in H6 only 6 is present out of 2, 5 and 6. H6 must have atleast 2 
candidates out of 2, 5 and 6. In this example, 2 and 5 make a Hidden Double in D6 and F6 cells.
And once 6 will be removed from D6 and F6 then 6 will make a Hidden Single in H6.
 
# notes elimination pattern
Logic behind eliminating the candidates
since in 6th column in below puzzle three candidates 2, 5 and 6 appear in these three cells D6, F6 and H6
only so these cells will be filled by these candidates only and all the other candidates 
will be removed from these cells.
500620037004890000000050000930000000020000605700000003000009000000000700680570002
so in 6th column 1, 3, 4, 7, 8 will be removed from D6, F6 and H6.
which candidate will fill exactly which cell is still unknown.
