TODO: explain why "Naked" is used here. it's explained for Naked Single.

In Naked Single, we focus on one candidate and one cell only. Naked Double is
the extension of Naked Single. Here we will focus on two candidates and two cells.

If you can find two cells, both in the same house, that have only the
same two candidates left, you can eliminate those two candidates from
all other cells in that house.

example puzzle
Naked Double in 5th block with 8, 9 candidates
687004523953002614142356978310007246760000305020000701096001032230000057070000069

cells A, B are both in the same house (row 8) and have both only candidates 8 and 9 left.
8 and 9 will go in these cells only and nowhere else. if you try to fill 8 or 9 anywhere else then
one of these cells will be left without any candidate and puzzle will not be solved.
which cell out of cellA or cellB will have 8 and which will be filled by 9 is still unknown.

either CellA will have 8 and cellB will have 9 like below
# show by filling these cells in separate colors

or CellA will have 9 and cellB will have 8 like this
# show by filling these cells in separate colors

Notice in both cases 8 and 9 highlighted above in red color have been removed.

A naked double is not limited to only one house.
in below example cellA and cellB are part of 8th row and 8th block both. so
6, 7 candidates make a naked double in 8th row and 8th block houses
800210047040089100000040000000098005090030000007001409000000000003000254200000008

and 6 and 7 will be removed from all the cells except cellA and cellB in 8th row and 8th block
